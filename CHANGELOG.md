# Dictation Checker Improvements Changelog

## May 15, 2023

### 15:00-16:00 - Initial Improvements
- ✅ Implemented interactive hint system with two levels:
  - Level 1: Shows first letter of each word with placeholders
  - Level 2: Shows first 2-3 letters based on word length
- ✅ Made hint system visually distinct with blue background and dotted underlines
- ✅ Fixed compound word handling for cases like "ontagmorgen" and "antagmorgen" 

### 16:00-16:10 - Fixed Berlin Double Letter Issue
- ✅ Fixed issue with duplicated first letter (like double "B" in "Berlin") in hint level 1
- ✅ Added special case handling for exact word matches with different capitalization

### 16:10-16:20 - Auto-capitalization for Proper Nouns
- ✅ Implemented auto-capitalization for proper nouns when capitalization checking is OFF
- ✅ Made visual appearance consistent across all hint levels (0, 1, and 2)

## Current Status (16:20)
- ✅ Hint system is working with proper visual styling
- ✅ Capitalization handling works correctly (proper nouns auto-capitalize when Aa is off)
- ✅ Fixed compound word handling for special cases
- ✅ Fixed duplicate letter bugs

## Remaining Issues
- ❌ Word alignment when switching hint modes sometimes places words at wrong positions
- ❌ Very short word endings (2-3 letters) might still behave inconsistently

## Next Steps
- Improve word alignment when user skips words
- Fine-tune the handling of very short word endings
- Test more complex scenarios with longer sentences

## Technical Debt
- Refactor the hint system into more modular components
- Add more comprehensive unit tests
- Improve documentation for hint system implementation
